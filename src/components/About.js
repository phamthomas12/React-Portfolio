                My curiosity for web development began in 2019 when I began working as the System Administrator for AQR, a 3PL Warehousing and Distribution Service Provider. We currently use a lot of web application in order to process and track orders coming and leaving the premises, slowly with my team tweaking and adding new functions to an already built web app.</p>
              
                <p id="about-text">
                I am passionate about creating seamless user experiences that delight customers and elevate a business. I am well positioned to provide unique perspectives on how a business can implement new technology into their business to allow sommoter business operations.</p>
